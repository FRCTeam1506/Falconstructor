# Notes

## Things to work on

- test to TurnToAngle
- ~~test distance~~
- ~~test standard align~~
- make pid for gyro align + ~~test gyro align~~
- ~~organize limelight pipelines~~
- make talon fx play music

##  Limelight Pipelines
| Pipeline | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| 0 | X |
| 1 | X |
| 2 | X |
| 3 | X |
| 4 | X |
| 5 | Target Targeting |
| 6 | 3x Zoomed Target Targeting |
| 7 | X |
| 8 | X |
| 9 | X |

## Limelight Distances
| Measurement | Position | Distance |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| 245in | Close Edge of Trench | 1,234 |
| 370in | In Front of Control Panel | 10,000 |

## Remember PID
- P - speed porportional to the error
- D - brake speed to combat overshoot
- I - small increments to get to setpoint
